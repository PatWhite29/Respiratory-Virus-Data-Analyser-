COVID-19 Sequence Analyzer and Mapping Tool

This project is a computational biology tool built in R, designed to analyze and visualize COVID-19 mutations, but i went the extra mile with the implementation of more than 30 diffrent Respiratory Virsuses (you can find them in this repository) that you can analyze, contrast and map data off. The main functionalities include comparing and contrasting 30 different mutations, processing large-scale genomic datasets, and generating visual representations of mutation patterns and evolutionary relationships.

Functionality

1. Mutation Comparison and Analysis

	•	The tool allows users to input large genomic datasets and identify mutation patterns across different COVID-19 strains. By leveraging R’s powerful data processing libraries, it enables detailed comparison of 20 distinct mutations, allowing researchers to spot trends and differences between them.
	•	The code uses custom scripts to handle DNA sequences efficiently, providing insights into how different mutations have evolved or spread geographically.

2. Advanced Data Processing

	•	The script processes large-scale DNA sequence data to extract relevant mutation details, including the location and type of mutations (e.g., substitutions, deletions, or insertions).
	•	It employs advanced filtering techniques to isolate the mutations of interest and compute their frequency across different datasets. The data is then cleaned and prepared for further analysis and visualization.

3. Data Visualization

	•	Graphs and Charts: The tool generates graphical representations of the mutation data, such as bar plots and line graphs that display mutation frequencies, helping users understand which mutations are more prevalent and in what context.
	•	World Map Visualization: Using geographic mapping tools, the code can trace the global distribution of specific mutations, highlighting regions where mutations have emerged or spread. This is particularly useful for tracking how the virus evolves in different geographic locations.
	•	Phylogenetic Trees: The tool also constructs phylogenetic trees, which depict the evolutionary relationships between the analyzed COVID-19 mutations. These trees help in understanding how different strains are related and their evolutionary history.
